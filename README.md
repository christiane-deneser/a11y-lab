# a11y-lab

Welcome to my **accessibility lab** – a sandbox where I explore, test, and document patterns for accessible, neuro-inclusive digital experiences.

This repository is intentionally **messy and experimental**.  
It’s where I:

- try out new HTML/ARIA patterns  
- document how components behave with keyboard and screen readers  
- test automated tools (axe, Accessibility Insights, Lighthouse…)  
- write down WCAG / EN 301 549 notes  
- play with AI-assisted accessibility workflows

## 🔬 What you’ll find here

### `components-experiments/`

Drafts, sketches, and experiments for accessible UI components, e.g.:

- `button/` – different button patterns, focus states, dark mode attempts, etc.
- `dialog/` – dialog structure, focus trapping, aria attributes
- more components as I explore them…

These are **not** final components – they’re stepping stones toward a more polished **Accessible Component Library**.

### `wcag-notes/`

My personal notes while studying **WCAG 2.2** (and related EN 301 549 requirements):

- principles in plain language  
- success criteria summaries  
- common failure patterns  
- testing ideas and edge cases  

These notes support my preparation for advanced accessibility roles and certifications (e.g., WAS-style exams).

### `testing-playground/`

Notes and findings from using accessibility tools, such as:

- **axe DevTools**
- **Accessibility Insights for Web**
- **Screen readers** (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
- Browser DevTools accessibility tree

This is where I log **real-world issues**, color contrast findings, and thoughts on how to fix them.

### `ai-workflows/`

Experiments where I combine **AI tools** with accessibility work:

- prompts for accessibility reviews  
- Copilot experiments for accessible patterns  
- generated documentation and checklists  
- ideas for neuro-inclusive & AI-adaptive design
